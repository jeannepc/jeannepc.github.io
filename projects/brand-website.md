summary: What is my brand?
---

I have been in the making of a new website to showcase my brand which will include apparel and ceramics. This will be in the making for another year, but I am hopeful that I will be able to sell handcrafted pieces. I am currently working with a dear graphic designer that I have known all my life to help with my logo and color palette. I have been using my own skills of UI/UX to organize the website uniquely and true to myself. 

One of the hardest parts so far was finding a graphic designer who shared my vision for this. I have chosen friends over skills and that has led to months delay and missed deadlines. I have learned from this and will be more strict on my own deadlines to stay on my projected timeline.

This project is still in its beginning stages as of this year and the products are yet to be disclosed, so stay tuned for what I will be creating for this world.
