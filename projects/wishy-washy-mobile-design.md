Have you ever changed the settings on your washing machine? If so, how often? I almost always change my water temperature settings whenever I was my clothes. I may need to change other settings too depending on the load. The preset options that the washer includes are not good enough. My app Wishy Washy allows for customizable preset options for the user to set.
