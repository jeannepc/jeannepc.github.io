## Why Software Engineering?
In middle school, I started coding games in a brand new club called Coding Club. I made these games to play with my friends. I really enjoyed getting feedback on how to make my game better and easier to use. I stick to those values now. In our constantly changing world, I must also constantly change my code for it to last. I am learning how to make the user's experience easier for any technical background. I try to make my applications inclusive, so anyone with any disabilities can still easily interact with my programs. A past mentor told me about how he always considered visually impaired people when determining the color contrast for background and text. I appreciated his effort in that. When I code, I code for everybody, I want my applications to be helpful and to make lives easier.

## Fundamental Coding Skills
I hope I can be more efficient at coding in a way that is logical to other coders. I strive for readable code because it lasts and allows for collaboration. If a method is difficult to understand, then that method will less likely be used again in other places in an application, but if it is clear and direct, then it will have easier use and functionality. I am excited to be working in groups in the future when I am in the software engineering career. I like talking to people, and I find it more efficient for me to talk about problems outloud. Brainstorming with others is one of the fastest ways I learn.

## My Aftermath of Software Engineering
When I am no longer developing software, I want to give back to my community. I dream for more women in computer science, and I want to encourage girls and minorities to start coding if they are at all interested. I am grateful for the opportunities I had in my school district, and I want those same opportunities given to everyone. I want technology and WiFi to be accessible to low-income families. Not only is a computer important for coding, but it is useful for researching and understanding the world using the world wide web. The web has an endless amount of information, and when used right, you can have all the knowledge in the world in your hand.
