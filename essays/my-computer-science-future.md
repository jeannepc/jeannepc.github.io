## My Baby Steps in Coding
I first started coding when I was about 13 years old. I never really thought of coding as a career, but as a hobby. My middle school teacher told me to join an afterschool club, and I ended up getting some of my great friends to go. It was something that I enjoyed and looked forward to afterschool. Getting with my friends and making computer games. My first program that I ever presented was a project in Python mainly using the turtle library. I made a two-player treasure hunt game, so I could play with my friends. I loved that I could add a background and images to my game to make it more fun and colorful. Since then, I haven't stopped coding.
